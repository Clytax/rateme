## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [BEM Naming convention](http://getbem.com/naming/)
- SCSS/SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I never really managed to create mobile responsive layouts, for some reason I always had problems with it. But here I managed to do enough research to succeed! I'm pretty excited about how it turned out ðŸ˜Š

### Continued development

I really wanna keep using React and try to keep doing the "Mobile first" workflow.

## Acknowledgments

Even though I worked alone on this project, I want to say how thankful I am for the front-end mentor! It's really amazing how much I learned by doing it. Youtube tutorials can only take you so far, but you have to do these things yourself to learn!
